#   Makefile C9-1

#   don't need them anymore, the file will be much more readable.

#  A list of 'special' targets:
#
#    clean     Remove all the temporary object files (.o)
#    mrproper  Clean everything, including the executable
#
#  You can execute those targets by typing 'make <target>'
#  (instead of simply 'make') at the command line.
#
#  The '.PHONY' target is special and internal to 'make'.
#  The purpose is that the actions for 'clean', 'doc'
#  and 'mrproper' are executed even if it happens to
#  be a file called 'clean', 'doc' or 'mrproper' in
#  the directory.
#  See the 'make' documentation for more information
#  (or google 'makefile PHONY').

.PHONY: clean mrproper doc

#  The list of the object files of the program
#  This list need to be updated if you add more files
#  to your program.
#
#  You can generate this list automatically from the
#  source file in 'src' with the 'wildcard' and
#  'patsubst' functions we saw in class (or, again,
#  google 'makefile wildcard' for example), although
#  I would advise you against it. (In particular
#  because it can be usefull to compile only a part of your
#  project when you have build errors.)

#  The list of the path to the object files: since
#  all the object files should be in the 'build'
#  directory, we add the prefix 'build/' to all
#  the elements in OBJ_LIST.

#   Finally, the list of the depandancies of the projects.
#
#   For small projects, it is not difficult to do this by
#   hand: for each source file (.cpp), list all the headers
#   that it includes, directly or indirectly (through another
#   header).
#
#   Of course, this can be done automatically. The simplest
#   way with modern versions of gcc is to add the '-MP' and
#   '-MD' options to the compiler: this will create a file
#   with extension '.d' for each of your source file, that
#   you can then include (with the 'include' command) in
#   your makefile.
#   A more 'traditional' way (which will work with older
#   compilers) is described here:
#      http://mad-scientist.net/make/autodep.html
#   
#   But for this project, it is certainly less work for
#   you to just carefully write all your depandancies
#   by hand.
